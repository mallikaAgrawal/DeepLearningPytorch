Contents of this Repo:
- **GradientDescent.ipynb** is a Jupyter Notebook that shows my implementation of the Gradient Descent algorithm to generate a solution boundary. After the 100th epoch, the solution boundary was over 94% accurate.
- **StudentAdmissions.ipynb** is a Jupyter Notebook that processes data on student admissions to graduate school at UCLA and trains a 2-layer Neural Network with well-documented code.
- PytorchModels:
    - Part 1 introduces how to make Tensors in Pytorch and the mathematics behind what happens when multiple layers are stacked up and how to calculate the output to a network.
    - Part 2 works with the nn module in PyTorch and builds the Neural Network that will classify handwritten digits.
    - Part 3 trains the Neural Network built in Part 2 on the MNIST dataset. We have now successfully completed the creation of a digit classifier model!
    - Part 4 builts and trains a Neural Network on the Fashion-MNIST dataset. Fashion-MNIST is a set of 28x28 greyscale images of clothes, and this model accurately classifies the pieces of clothing.
    - Parts 5 and beyond not updated yet! Coming soon!
